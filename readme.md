# AI-Integrated Human Detection Night Security System

This advanced security system leverages the power of artificial intelligence to 
monitor and detect human presence in real-time. Built around an Arduino Uno, 
a webcam, and the YOLO object detection model, the system continuously scans 
the environment to identify any human activity. 
Upon detection, it immediately sends an email notification to the user, 
complete with an image captured by the webcam for further review. 
This system combines cutting-edge technology with practical functionality, 
providing enhanced security and peace of mind, especially during nighttime.
